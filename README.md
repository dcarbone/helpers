### JSON To UL

```php
$jsonString = <<<STRING
{
   "glossary": {
       "title": "example glossary",
    "GlossDiv": {
           "title": "S",
        "GlossList": {
               "GlossEntry": {
                   "ID": "SGML",
                "SortAs": "SGML",
                "GlossTerm": "Standard Generalized Markup Language",
                "Acronym": "SGML",
                "Abbrev": "ISO 8879:1986",
                "GlossDef": {
                       "para": "A meta-markup language, used to create markup languages such as DocBook.",
                    "GlossSeeAlso": ["GML", "XML"]
                   },
                "GlossSee": "markup"
               }
           }
       }
   }
}
STRING;

echo JSONToUl::invoke($jsonString);

```

### DOMPlus

This class was inspired by <a href="http://beerpla.net/projects/smartdomdocument-a-smarter-php-domdocument-class/" target="_blank">Artem Russakovskii's SmartDOMDocument Class</a>.

In versions of PHP prior to 5.3.6, one of the most annoying issues with the DOMDocument class is that you cannot export
to html from a specific node.

This class allows you to not only do that for older versions of PHP, but also adds a method which strips all of the non-important
elements from the output string (doctype, html, header, body).

It is an extension of the base DOMDocument class, so it has all of the same methods the base class does.  What is available depends on the version of PHP you are running.

If you have a version of PHP >= 5.3.6, it defers to base method functionality.

```php
$dom = new DOMPlus();
$dom->loadHTML('your html string');

echo $dom->saveHTMLExact();

$element = $dom->getElementById('id of element');

echo $dom->saveHTMLExact($element);
```
